# parking-lot
In this project, we will create a parking lot management program that keeps track of vacant spots and parked cars.

https://github.com/chudu13/parking-lot.wiki.git
The parking lot should allow the user to park the car.
You can enter the following commands on the command line:
1)create (to specify the number of spots on the parking lot) - For example -> create 10
2)park (to park the car) - After the user has entered this command, the registration number and the color of the car should be specified. For example -> park KA-01-HH-1234 Blue.The registration number should not contain spaces. The color can be written in either uppercase and lowercase letters.
3)leave (to pick up the car) - After the user has entered this command, the number of the parking spot should be specified. For example -> leave 1
4)reg_by_color (to get numbers of cars of a particular color) - The color may be written in uppercase or lowercase letters. For example -> reg_by_color BLACK
5)spot_by_color (to get parking space numbers of all the cars of a particular color) - Is similar to the previous one
6)spot_by_reg (to get the number of the spot where a car is located) - For example -> spot_by_reg KA-01-HH-3672
7)status (to get all occupied spots in ascending order) - For each spot, it should print the spot number, the carâ€™s plate registration number, and the color of the car, all separated by spaces.
8)exit (to end the program)
